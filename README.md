# 3D Human Reconstruction

## Overview

**3D Human Reconstruction** is a project that converts 2D images into a 3D model representation of a human figure. This process involves various stages like image processing, pose estimation, and reconstruction using advanced techniques in computer vision and machine learning.

## Features

- Converts 2D images to 3D human models.
- Utilizes cutting-edge algorithms for pose estimation.
- Supports various input formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
- Outputs a detailed, accurate 3D mesh of human figures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Python 3.x**: The project is built using Python, so you need Python 3.x to run it.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **PyTorch**: For machine learning and deep learning tasks.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical computations.

You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
